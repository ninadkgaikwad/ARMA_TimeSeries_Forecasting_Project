You are required to follow the IEEE journal style when you submit a report, be it a midterm or the final project. The report you submit must be a single PDF file, along with accompanying matlab code. MS word or any other format will not be accepted. More than one pdf file also will not be accepted.

Whether you use MS Word or Latex to write your report, the best place to find templates for IEEE journal styles is 

https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/create-your-ieee-article/use-authoring-tools-and-ieee-article-templates/ieee-article-templates/templates-for-transactions/

In case you have difficulty with the url, I have provided the MS Word and LaTeX templates in the two folders (“Word” and “Latex”). But these are downloaded from the url above; I didn’t create them. In case you are having difficulty with the files I have uploaded, I suggest you download them again from the url above.
